What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    The .git file is produced. The command enables a repository in this particular folder, but it does not add anythin 
by default into this repository.  

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  Probably (?) the changes made in the staging area are tracked. I am not sure what is the added value, except that 
it allows committing files one by one, rather than alltogether.
