When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I am collaborating with other people. Maybe if I need a reliable backup? (minor concern).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Probably because sometimes there will be versions and branches that I do not necessarily want to see on my computer. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you  use one instead of another? 

   Forking is a procedure reserved to the github: one can copy someone directory to his own account on github. Clone is a procedure of coping a repository from remote accout to local or from a local to a local. Branches are the new developments in the same repository. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  Avoid unnecessary clashes between the versions. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  Working in parallel would be easier now. Being aggressive changing the working codes will be easier as well.
