When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I am collaborating with other people. Maybe if I need a reliable backup? (minor concern).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Probably because sometimes there will be versions and branches that I do not necessarily want to see on my computer.
